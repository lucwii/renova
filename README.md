This template provides a minimal, production-ready setup for building React applications with TypeScript and Vite. It offers a streamlined development experience with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and pre-configured ESLint rules, promoting code quality and consistency. Renova is designed to accelerate your development process, offering a solid foundation with best practices baked in.

**Key Benefits:**

-   **Fast Development:** Vite's lightning-fast build times and HMR enable rapid iteration and a smooth development workflow. Spend less time waiting and more time coding.
-   **TypeScript Ready:** Enjoy the benefits of static typing with TypeScript, catching errors early and improving code maintainability. Reduce runtime errors and improve code clarity.
-   **Code Quality:** Pre-configured ESLint rules help enforce code style and best practices, leading to cleaner and more consistent codebases. Maintain a high standard of code quality across your project.
-   **Production-Ready:** A solid foundation for building scalable and maintainable React applications. Start your project with confidence, knowing you have a robust base.

**Intended Use Cases:**

-   Rapid prototyping of React components and applications
-   Starting point for new React projects with TypeScript
-   Learning resource for integrating React, TypeScript, and Vite
-   Building single-page applications (SPAs)
-   Creating reusable React component libraries

## Project Structure

> Explain the project structure here.  For example:
> > Using your chosen package manager:

> **npm:**
> bash
> npm install
> npm run dev
> # or
> **yarn:**
> bash
> yarn install
> yarn dev
> # or
> **pnpm:**
> bash
> pnpm install
> pnpm dev

## Committing Changes

Here's a basic guide to committing changes using Git:

1.  **Stage your changes:**
> bash
> git add .
2.  **Commit your changes:**
> bash
> git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
3.  **Push your changes (after you have connected your local repository to a remote repository like Github, Gitlab, or Bitbucket):**
> bash
> git push origin main

## Enhancing ESLint Configuration

This template includes basic ESLint rules. For production applications, enhancing the configuration to enable type-aware linting is highly recommended. Type-aware linting leverages the TypeScript compiler to provide more accurate and powerful linting capabilities.

Here's how to update your ESLint configuration (`.eslintrc.cjs` or `eslint.config.js`):

> javascript
> // .eslintrc.cjs or eslint.config.js
> module.exports = {
>  // ... other configurations
>  extends: [
>    // ... other extends
>    'plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked',
>    'plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked',
>    'plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked',
>  ],
>  parserOptions: {
>    project: ['./tsconfig.json'],
>    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
>  },
> };

> -   `recommendedTypeChecked`, `strictTypeChecked`, and `stylisticTypeChecked`: These configurations from `@typescript-eslint` enable rules that require type information. `strictTypeChecked` is the strictest, while `stylisticTypeChecked` adds stylistic rules. Choose the one that best suits your project's needs. Consider starting with `recommendedTypeChecked` and gradually enabling stricter rules as your project evolves.
> -   `parserOptions.project`: This tells ESLint where to find your `tsconfig.json` files. This is crucial for type-aware linting to work correctly. Make sure to include all relevant `tsconfig.json` files in your project, especially if you have multiple `tsconfig.json` files for different parts of your application (e.g., `tsconfig.node.json`, `tsconfig.app.json`).
> -   `tsconfigRootDir`: Sets the root directory for resolving the `tsconfig.json` paths, especially useful in monorepo setups. If your `tsconfig.json` file is in the same directory as your `.eslintrc.cjs` or `eslint.config.js`, you can usually set this to `__dirname`.

## Integrating `eslint-plugin-react-x` and `eslint-plugin-react-dom`

These plugins provide React-specific linting rules. To integrate them:

1.  **Install the plugins:**

> bash
> npm install eslint-plugin-react-x eslint-plugin-react-dom --save-dev

2.  **Update your ESLint configuration:**

> javascript
> // .eslintrc.cjs or eslint.config.js
> module.exports = {
>  // ... other configurations
>  plugins: [
>    // ... other plugins
>    'react-x',
>    'react-dom',
>  ],
>  extends: [
>    // ... other extends
>    'plugin:react-x/recommended',
>    'plugin:react-dom/recommended',
>  ],
>  rules: {
>    // ... your custom rules
>  },
> };

## Troubleshooting

-   **"ESLint: Failed to load plugin 'react'":**

    -   Ensure that `eslint-plugin-react` (or `eslint-plugin-react-x` and `eslint-plugin-react-dom`) is installed as a dev dependency (`npm install eslint-plugin-react --save-dev`). Double-check the package name for typos.
    -   Verify that the plugin is correctly referenced in your ESLint configuration file (`.eslintrc.cjs` or `eslint.config.js`). Ensure the plugin name matches the installed package name.

-   **Type-aware linting not working:**

    -   Double-check that `parserOptions.project` in your ESLint configuration points to the correct `tsconfig.json` files. Verify the paths are correct relative to your ESLint configuration file.
    -   Make sure you are using a version of `@typescript-eslint/*` that supports type-aware linting. Check the `@typescript-eslint` documentation for compatibility information.
    -   Ensure your `tsconfig.json` includes the necessary compiler options, such as `"strict": true` or individual strictness flags (e.g., `"strictNullChecks": true`).

-   **Vite server not starting:**

    -   Ensure that all dependencies are installed correctly. Try deleting your `node_modules` folder and running `npm install`, `yarn install`, or `pnpm install` again.
    -   Check for any errors in your `vite.config.ts` file. Pay attention to syntax errors or incorrect configurations.
    -   Verify that the port Vite is trying to use is not already in use by another application.

-   **ESLint or TypeScript errors in VS Code:**

    -   Make sure you have the ESLint and TypeScript extensions installed in VS Code.
    -   Check your VS Code settings to ensure that the extensions are enabled and configured correctly.
    -   Restart VS Code to ensure that the extensions pick up any changes to your project's configuration.

## Updating Dependencies

To keep your project up-to-date, regularly update dependencies:

> bash
> npm update
> # or
> yarn upgrade
> # or
> pnpm update
